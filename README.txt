Hi, this is a simple music guessing game I made with inspiration from https://github.com/adam-goodrich/MP3_Game

You can run this in terminal or any IDE.

After running, pick a folder with MP3s (the more the better) for your game.

The song will play for 3 seconds, press m for more time or a for the answer.

This game was designed to be played with friends over discord with the host of the game streaming their screen.

Enjoy
